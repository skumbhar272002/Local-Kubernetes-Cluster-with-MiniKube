# LocaL Kubernetes Cluster using Minikube

This repository contains the deployment configuration and source code for an Employee Management System designed to run on a Kubernetes cluster using Minikube. It showcases an automated CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, containerization with Docker, and monitoring through the Kubernetes Dashboard.

## Project Overview

The LocaL Kubernetes Cluster using Minikube is designed to demonstrate a fully operational DevOps pipeline utilizing Kubernetes, Docker, and GitHub Actions. It emphasizes best practices in continuous integration, continuous deployment, and infrastructure management, suitable for scalable cloud environments.

## Features

- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Utilizes Minikube for local cluster deployment.
- **Docker Integration**: Containerization of the application for consistent development, testing, and production environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated workflows for CI/CD to build, test, and deploy the application upon commits.
- **Kubernetes Dashboard**: Monitoring and managing the Kubernetes cluster's resources and health.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)
- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [GitHub Account](https://github.com/)
